# VBA of Wall Street - Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Using Excel and VBA, analyze and compare stock data to help our friend Steve help his parents make a smart investment decision.

# Results
Our research included analyzing stock performance for a group of stocks in 2017 and 2018. See VBA_Challenge.xlsm for full output.
We included 2 code solutions for analyzing the data, an original set of code as well as a refactored set.
The results of our research determined that stock performance for this particular group of stocks was much better in 2017 than 2018.
VBA_Challenge_2017.png indicates that all but 1 of the stocks on our list resulted in a positive return for the year.
VBA_Challenge_2018.png, however, shows that only 2 of our stocks resulted in a positive return for the year.

# Summary
Using the results of our research, I would recommend that Steve and his parents do additional research on ENPH. It had positive results in both 2017 and 2018.

*What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?*

Refactoring code gives developers an opportunity to improve upon an original code set. Skilled coders would potentially be able to improve query times, and/or possibly make their code set more efficient. 
On the other hand, refactoring can take a lot of time, especially for novice coders like myself. In addition, refactoring may not always improve efficiency.

*How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?*

If you compare the query times between my original and refactored code, you can see that my original code returned results faster.
VBA_Challenge_OriginalCode_2017.png shows that my original queryt had a query time of approximately 1.82 seconds, with the refactored code pulling the same info in 2.61 seconds.
 (VBA_Challenge_2017.png). 
Similar results were returned for 2018 as well: 1.62 seconds query time for the original 2018 code (VBA_Challenge_OriginalCode_2018.png) vs 2.55 seconds for the refactored code.
